# RAG Applications: Putting It All Together

Congratulations! You've learned all the core concepts of RAG. Now it's time to put everything together and deploy your application with Vercel.

## Final Project Requirements

For your capstone project, you'll build a complete RAG application that demonstrates your understanding of:

1. **Data Collection & Processing**: Scraping and chunking relevant content
2. **Vector Storage**: Properly configured Pinecone index
3. **Embedding Generation**: Correct OpenAI embedding model
4. **RAG Pipeline**: Efficient retrieval and generation
5. **User Interface**: Clean, responsive design with streaming responses

For detailed instructions on implementing a streaming UI, refer to Section 8: Building a Streaming UI with Next.js.

## Vercel AI SDK Integration

The [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) provides a set of tools that make it easy to build AI-powered applications with streaming responses. It's particularly well-suited for RAG applications as it offers:

- Streaming responses with minimal client-side code
- Type-safe interfaces for AI providers
- Built-in React hooks for UI state management
- Optimistic updates for better user experience

On the client side, you can use the `useChat` hook to handle the chat state as shown in Section 8.

For detailed implementation instructions, check out the [Vercel AI SDK documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) and Section 8 of this curriculum.

## Next Steps

Now that you've built a basic RAG application, you can:

1. Deploy your application to Vercel with one click
2. Monitor your application's performance with Vercel Analytics
3. Scale your application with Vercel's serverless infrastructure
4. Extend your application with the techniques covered in Section 8
