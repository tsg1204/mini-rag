# What is RAG?

Welcome to the world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)! By the end of this curriculum, you'll have built a full-stack RAG application using TypeScript, Next.js, Pinecone, and OpenAI. 

But first, let's understand what we're building and why it matters.

## The Problem RAG Solves

Imagine you're building a chatbot for your company's internal documentation. You could train a massive language model on all your docs, but that's expensive and the model might "hallucinate" or make up information that sounds plausible but is wrong.

What if instead, you could:
1. Store all your documents in a searchable format
2. When a user asks a question, find the most relevant documents
3. Feed those specific documents to a language model as context
4. Let the model answer based on that real, up-to-date information

That's exactly what RAG does!

## RAG in Simple Terms

RAG combines two powerful concepts:

**Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
**Generation**: Using that information to generate accurate, contextual responses

Think of it like an open-book exam for AI. Instead of memorizing everything, the AI can "look up" relevant information and then provide answers based on that specific context.

## Real-World RAG Applications

- **Customer Support**: Answer questions based on your knowledge base
- **Internal Tools**: Query company documents, policies, and procedures  
- **Educational Platforms**: Personalized tutoring based on course materials
- **Legal Research**: Find relevant case law and regulations
- **Medical Assistance**: Reference medical literature for diagnoses

## What We'll Build Together

Throughout this curriculum, we'll build a **Document Q&A System** that can:

- Ingest and process various document types (PDFs, web pages, text files)
- Convert documents into searchable vector embeddings
- Store embeddings in Pinecone (a vector database)
- Accept user questions through a Next.js interface
- Retrieve relevant document chunks
- Generate accurate answers using OpenAI's GPT models
- Handle follow-up questions with conversation context

And we'll do it all with **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience.

## Prerequisites Check

Before we dive in, make sure you're comfortable with:

- **TypeScript fundamentals** (we'll be using it throughout)
- **Next.js and React** (our frontend framework)
- **REST APIs** (we'll build several endpoints)
- **Basic database concepts** (though vector databases are different!)

Don't worry if you haven't worked with AI/ML before - we'll cover everything you need to know!

## Our Learning Path

Here's what we'll cover in this curriculum:

1. **RAG Fundamentals** - Understanding the concepts and architecture
2. **Vector Math Basics** - Just enough linear algebra to understand embeddings  
3. **Pinecone Setup** - Getting our vector database ready
4. **OpenAI Integration** - Working with embeddings and chat completions
5. **Document Processing** - Scraping and preparing data
6. **Building the RAG Pipeline** - Connecting all the pieces
7. **Full-Stack Implementation** - Next.js app with TypeScript
8. **Fine-Tuning Concepts** - When and how to customize models
9. **Advanced Techniques** - Improving accuracy and performance
10. **Final Project** - Build your own RAG application

Let's build.
