While that’s not exactly wrong, there is a lot of nuance, expected behavior and implied knowledge that comes along with the job and picking up on these unspoken rules can be just as important as your company’s mission to create the AirBnB of children’s tree houses or the DoorDash for embarrassing medicine prescriptions or whatever.</p><p name="6dd8" id="6dd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During my first year as a developer, I had to make a mental shift in order to get used to the culture of working in software. Luckily, I had a very understanding team that did a lot of hand-holding and explicitly laid out some of the most obvious expectations for me like what happens during daily stand up or the process for doing code reviews but much of what I picked up during that first year isn’t taught in any bootcamp or class.</p><p name="b7fa" id="b7fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">When Do I Ask For Help?</strong></p><p name="b789" id="b789" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a noob to the software world, this is one of the most pervasive questions I hear from people about to start their first day. Now, every (good) team will encourage questions from new hires in order to help them ramp up, but there is a limit to your team’s patience and you’ll find some members more agreeable than others to lend a hand.</p><p name="87d5" id="87d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My rule of thumb (that I sometimes struggle to follow) is that if I haven’t made much progress in an hour of struggling through an issue, I will alert either the entire team via a shared channel on Slack or DM someone that is familiar with the issue at hand.</p><p name="780a" id="780a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I figure, if you’re getting paid to write code, you don’t want to spend 8 hours fumbling around when a co-worker can get you on track in a few minutes of time. Conversely, disrupting co-workers in the middle of a difficult task before doing any Googling will make you a burden on some unlucky person and no one wants that.</p><p name="7860" id="7860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, add details to those issues you’re stuck on: how to reproduce the problem, any error messages, and any other relevant details which reduce the cognitive load on your partner.</p><p name="e8d5" id="e8d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lastly, when someone has earphones on, it’s best to tread with caution. This is usually a signal that they are trying to focus. This is why I like to ask questions via a team channel and that way people can share asynchronous feedback or offer help at their convenience.</p><p name="ba50" id="ba50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Detach Yourself from Code Reviews</strong></p><p name="ab2f" id="ab2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My first, second, third, hell, my tenth code review stung to read. My ego was bruised, look at all these suggestions, I thought to myself. And to top it off, they’re written so matter-of-factly: “this doesn’t make sense here”, “is this necessary?”, “re-write to make more DRY.” Without the benefit of hearing a voice behind code review comments, they can often sound deflating or at worst, downright mean.</p><p name="9ba3" id="9ba3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s taken me a while to shake the jitters from receiving particularly critical reviews but although writing code can feel like writing a novel for some people, your work of art is mostly functional and good code reviews can help you level up your skills as well as make the code just work better, which is the ultimate goal. It’s usually best to look at your code as more of a surgical procedure rather than a creative masterpiece.</p><p name="5aab" id="5aab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While your first reviews may feel a bit jarring, also take time to really understand what the reviewer is asking and if your team is any good, the review should be less of a laundry list of tasks and more of a conversation. Instead of “this doesn’t work as expected” — try “have you considered doing x or y instead of your current approach — let me know what you think.” Even if your team doesn’t follow this approach — I personally think creating more conversational reviews is a great way to positively influence the engineering culture.</p><p name="f80a" id="f80a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Comments</strong></p><p name="326b" id="326b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All that code you wrote in the comfort of your own home probably had like, 1 contributor: you! Now here you are on a team of more than 1 pushing and pulling things to GitHub and touching codebases larger than you realized could exist. This is the time to make sure your communication via comments is helpful to those that come after you.</p><p name="2d0e" id="2d0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve heard some people say that good code should be self-documenting and while I agree that an over-reliance on comments is a code-smell (something that points to a deeper problem) I feel that certain pieces of code that either break some convention or are not completely obvious need to be explicitly called out through comments. It’s happened more than once where I’ve stared at a piece of code which I’m ready to refactor only to go down the rabbit hole and find that in 1998 some dev wrote it because it stops an obscure bug from happening when Daylight Savings time goes into effect. Go figure.</p><p name="281e" id="281e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Speaking of comments, your PR requests in GitHub should always have some description of what you’ve done. It’s frustrating getting a PR with several files changed and no word on what is supposed to be happening. Now I’m the detective in a mystery where I’m not sure what crime has been committed.</p><p name="a17b" id="a17b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It’s So Quiet Over Here</strong></p><p name="d4f3" id="d4f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software teams are quiet. Oddly, this is the thing that tripped me out the most when I began working as a dev. Every company I’ve gone to has been largely the same: the place where the devs are located is always much quieter than the rest of the office. The sales people are schmoozing it up over the phone and usually amongst one another, the product people are having lunch and talking over some designs or maybe playing a game, and the devs, well, they have their earphones on, staring intently at their double monitors.</p><p name="b854" id="b854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is of course a bit of a generalization but after working for a few companies and interviewing at even more, this stereotype seems to hold some weight. There’s nothing wrong with the quietness, in fact, it makes sense considering devs are likely solving problems which require a lot of concentration but if you are coming from a career outside of tech, this may surprise you.</p><p name="e65e" id="e65e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">&lt;Insert Weirdly Specific Company Policy Here&gt;</strong></p><p name="d8d9" id="d8d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’ve listed a few of the most common unspoken rules that you will see dev teams follow but every company has it’s own twist on engineering culture and the quicker you understand it, the faster you will be able to integrate into the team and focus on what’s really important — making the next Zillow for taco trucks or whatever.</p></div></div></section>
