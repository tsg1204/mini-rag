The class was not going well and one student, in particular, was derailing our lesson. After class, this student approached me.</p><p name="d63c" id="d63c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You know, this stuff is hard. You’re teaching way too fast for me to keep up. This stuff might be easy for you but we didn’t all grow up using computers or learning to code.”</p><p name="5c98" id="5c98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was a bit stunned and apologized, assuring him we could work outside of class to get him caught up. I was also flattered. My transformation was finally complete. He saw me for what I had trying so hard to look like for years…. a real software developer.</p><p name="85c7" id="85c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9 years ago, no one would have believed that I’d be writing code for a living, let alone managing and mentoring other engineers. Back then my life was a complete and utter mess.</p><p name="53fa" id="53fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the majority of my 20’s, I sold drugs. Weed, blow, meth, ecstasy and whatever else I could get my hands on. I was decent at it too. I made enough money to pay my rent, drink every night and support my own cocaine habit I’d picked up when I was 16.</p><p name="38e0" id="38e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, my drinking and snorting spun out of control. I was getting sloppy and taking risks I shouldn’t have. I was robbed twice at gunpoint and almost lost my life. The same guy who robbed me killed a man the next week after my robbery. I was barely sleeping, going days at a time getting high on meth and blowing then drinking to slow my racing heart down. I was taking drugs like coffee — as soon I woke up, I’d blow a line or pour a drink. At this rate, I was going to die of a heart attack or get killed in the streets.</p><p name="b777" id="b777" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My girlfriend worked during the day so the magnitude of my addiction may not have been clear to her and I spent most of my time doing “business” anyways. I came home one night, wired up and a bit drunk. She was pregnant.</p><p name="6222" id="6222" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the part where I turn my life around, I thought. Just like in the movies. If this new baby didn’t get me to change, then nothing will. I vowed to stop drinking and doing drugs… then the morning came. I had enough blow to kill a small horse in my cabinet at the house where I conducted my business. I thought about flushing it down the toilet. I would stop, I told myself, just after this last line.</p><p name="0ac1" id="0ac1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9 months later my son was born and I was still finishing that last line. In that year I was able to get a job at a local community college with a lot of help from a friend who worked there. I had mostly left the drug dealing phase of my life but there was never more than a day that would go by that I wouldn’t imbibe. My dealing was mostly relegated to small deals here and there to supplement my income and support my habit.</p><p name="23e0" id="23e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I likely would have continued this hamster wheel of drinking, drugs and petty dealing until I died or was arrested. The inevitable end was getting closer and I could feel it. The police in the area knew who I was and I’d been lucky enough to escape once during a traffic stop. I had old dealers calling my phone, threatening to kill me for deals I’d set up that had gone wrong. I was having panic attacks every day… literally. If the cops or the streets didn’t catch up with me my heart would.</p><p name="2ca2" id="2ca2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, something happened.</p><p name="af78" id="af78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9 years ago, on Easter Sunday I stumbled into my house drunk and still high from the night before. I was walking back home after getting into a small car accident with my friend who had driven over a median in the road and popped all his tires. I hadn’t slept in 24 hours and made my way to the bed to pass out if my heart would stop its racing. My newborn son was nearly a year old.</p><p name="eac6" id="eac6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few weeks earlier, another friend of mine had committed suicide and his brother, one of my best customers had been sentenced to prison for human trafficking for pimping. My drinking had soared to new heights during this stressful period. At my lowest point, I can remember being under a bridge near my house, smoking meth with a group of transients who lived there.</p><p name="9196" id="9196" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother and girlfriend were so concerned with my drinking and snorting that they got together, and unbeknownst to me, planned an intervention that Easter Sunday. My mother barged into the house moments after I fell into the bed. We walked outside and she read me a letter that contained an ultimatum: get sober or my family would leave me. I was angry. Who were they to put this on me at this time? I was grieving and stressed. This was the worst possible time to quit. I resented them for doing this to me but I reluctantly agreed with no clue how I would stop.</p><p name="fdff" id="fdff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t drink or do drugs the next day after she read me that letter. I would just not drink for one day at a time. Each day I woke up, I made a commitment not to drink just for that day.</p><p name="b392" id="b392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, the days turned to a couple of months. My body had finally settled into a rhythm but the mental anguish remained. I dreamt about drinking a lot. I had fantasies of going back to my old life. I also had a lot more free time. Jesus, what was I supposed to do with all this time?</p><p name="3ebe" id="3ebe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At work, I took on more responsibility. One of my tasks was to keep our janky website updated with information around upcoming events. A particular update required an actual code change which I had no clue how to do. I called our webmaster and scheduled some time for her to visit our office and make the update. When she opened the code editor I saw what looked like a set of hieroglyphs. I was shocked that she seemed to understand what was there.</p><p name="6a85" id="6a85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is all that? I asked. She explained that all websites use HTML and CSS under the hood to display their content and add styling. I pressed her for more information about how she knew where to go and what to type. I was still in disbelief that a human could decipher this and navigate it so easily. I used the internet every day… how the hell did I not know how to do this?</p><p name="7061" id="7061" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She told me if I wanted to learn how to build websites I could learn HTML and CSS. Why the hell, not I figured, I had plenty of time. I searched for free courses on coding and picked up HTML and CSS. Once I made something appear on the screen I was hooked. This was my new addiction. I spent an inordinate amount of time learning to code and it filled the hole that alcohol and drugs previously had.</p><p name="eabe" id="eabe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9 years and a lot of studying later, I’m an Engineering Manager who’s taught at multiple bootcamps, worked at different companies, written dozens of articles and mentored lots of people. I still dream about drinking pretty often though I don’t plan on ever drinking again in my life.</p><p name="a2e2" id="a2e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been scared to tell people about this side of my life. I’ve worked so hard to become a different person that I feared exposing my past would make people see me as less capable.</p><p name="2f69" id="2f69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Is he a risk to work with?</em></p><p name="4499" id="4499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What if he slips up again?</em></p><p name="e280" id="e280" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if a co-worker reads this? Or a potential employer? What will they think of me?</p><p name="ec23" id="ec23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Honestly, I still have these fears but I also know that when I was learning to code, I met a lot of great people who helped me transition my life and career and hearing their stories gave me the boost to keep going when I felt like their might not be a light at the end of the tunnel. When I hear stories of people who come out of addiction to pursue their dreams and control their demons, I can see myself in them and I feel less alone.</p><p name="cee4" id="cee4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope if you’re reading this and you are going through a struggle with addiction in your life, that you feel less alone too and know that there isn’t a hole you’ve dug that’s too deep to pull yourself out of.</p><p name="801b" id="801b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I know you can do it.</p></div></div></section>
