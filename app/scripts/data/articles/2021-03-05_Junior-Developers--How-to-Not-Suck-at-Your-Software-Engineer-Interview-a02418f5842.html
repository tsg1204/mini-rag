Our engineering team is likely to double before the year’s end and we recently did around 20 interviews for 2 open junior roles on our team. These roles, like most you will see nowadays, require Javascript and more specifically ReactJS.</p><p name="f940" id="f940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nearly all of the interviewees went to a bootcamp which taught React, Javascript and typically NodeJS and MongoDB. The MERN stack seemed to be a popular stack at bootcamps across the board. After doing around a dozen interviews, some patterns really started to emerge in the process.</p><h4 name="f22c" id="f22c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">HTML and CSS — what’s that?</h4><p name="4d9b" id="4d9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Bootcamps have a short amount of time to cover the basics of web development, teach you a framework, databases, some algorithms and how to deploy your app among other things. They’ve collectively decided that HTML and CSS were the most dispensable things they could eschew it seems.</p><p name="70c8" id="70c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was consistently surprised (shocked?) that candidates struggled or plain didn’t know the difference between classes and ids. Some general concepts/features I would expect to receive for an entry level position would include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ede9" id="ede9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">FlexBox</li><li name="0571" id="0571" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Box Model</li><li name="5e97" id="5e97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">IDs/classes</li><li name="d1b8" id="d1b8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">HTML5 features</li><li name="e124" id="e124" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pseudo-elements</li></ul><h4 name="c99c" id="c99c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Can You Explain…</h4><p name="0773" id="0773" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">One of the most common pitfalls our junior interviewees made during the interview was not being able to explain a concept without relying on screen sharing. While I understand that it’s often easier to show someone rather than explain — it can appear to indicate a lack of understanding.</p><p name="7913" id="7913" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we ask how would you explain promises to someone who doesn’t know what they are and you show us a working implementation of a promise, it doesn’t necessarily mean you know much about it beyond how to use it.</p><p name="d225" id="d225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learning to speak about abstract concepts can be difficult. Reading articles about topics which confuse you and writing notes explaining, in plain English, things like closure, promises and asynchronous programming will get you closer to true understanding.</p><p name="26a7" id="26a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a rule of thumb, if you can’t explain a concept to a 5 year old, you probably don’t know it that well.</p><h4 name="cd90" id="cd90" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Javascript</h4><p name="1478" id="1478" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Our interview centered primarily on Javascript knowledge since that is the language we use for both our micro-services and front-ends. JS has a low barrier for entry, as far as learning is concerned which has advantages and uhhh, not so advantages. Nearly anyone can quickly crank out some poorly written Javascript but as interviewers we want to test whether you have the fundamentals down or just a cursory understanding.</p><p name="71ba" id="71ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Javascript ecosystem is so large and encompassing that there’s no way we could reasonably expect you to know all the quirks and obscure details of the language but when an interviewee says they have never used any of the many ES6 features such as <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">map, reduce, filter</code> or knows the difference between <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">const</code> and <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">let</code> it certainly raises some concerns.</p><p name="fe6e" id="fe6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been through more than a few Javascript interviews and here are the questions I’ve been asked the most:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0ba1" id="0ba1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Difference between apply, bind, call</li><li name="505e" id="505e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Closure — what is it and how would you use it?</li><li name="7dd0" id="7dd0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Event delegation</li><li name="dd73" id="dd73" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is the event loop?</li><li name="b9f7" id="b9f7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Difference between <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">map</code> and <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">forEach</code></li><li name="8d0e" id="8d0e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What are some of the benefits of functional programming?</li><li name="70bb" id="70bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Difference between <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">const</code> and <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">let</code></li><li name="b604" id="b604" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Prototypical inheritance vs class inheritance (for Juniors, this is kind of a stretch question — be prepared to explain the prototype chain)</li><li name="62ca" id="62ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">this</code></li></ul><p name="8fd9" id="8fd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This is by no means an exhaustive list, but these questions are so common I still rely on them for brush-up material.</p><p name="1167" id="1167" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While interviewers (well, us at least) may not expect you to have an in depth answer for many of these questions, it’s always impressive when a candidate can do a deeper dive into one of these concepts… without screen sharing hopefully.</p><h4 name="3bf6" id="3bf6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Any Questions for Us</h4><p name="bb81" id="bb81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Most of the candidates we interviewed had thoughtful questions about what work is like, aspects of our job we like/don’t like and the on-boarding process.</p><p name="9a96" id="9a96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many of these conversations were insightful and allowed the interviewee to learn more about us and the job.</p><p name="aaeb" id="aaeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some other candidates seemed wholly unprepared to ask any questions beyond what are the next steps. A smaller number did not seem to know anything about our company and asked questions that showed they did about zero research before walking into that zoom call.</p><p name="5086" id="5086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If you are a junior on the job hunt, you likely are juggling a lot plates — studying, LinkedIn, writing and re-writing your resume and applying for every job you find on the internets. I would only advise you do some minimal research on the company you are interviewing and your interviewers. Check out their LinkedIn profiles and see if you can gain any insight into them and what they’ve worked on. Maybe they’ve written an article like this 😉.</p></div></div></section><section name="543d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><div name="78f4" id="78f4" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf--leading"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1914092198764804" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1914092198764804" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1914092198764804"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Ask a Senior Developer</strong><br>www.facebook.com</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1914092198764804" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage mixtapeImage--empty u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="f2a1dcd9972b50322a40b8d6be9a3dce"></a></div><div name="645a" id="645a" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjenney/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjenney/" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjenney/"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Brian Jenney - Senior Software Engineer - The Clorox Company | LinkedIn</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Problem solving through code is my job and my hobby.
