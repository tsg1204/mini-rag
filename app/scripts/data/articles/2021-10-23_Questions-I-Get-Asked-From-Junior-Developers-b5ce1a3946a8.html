Here are the top questions I get from people who are starting their careers as developers or thinking of looking into a career where they write code for a living:</p><h4 name="88f9" id="88f9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What Should I Learn?</h4><p name="439b" id="439b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Well, it depends. If you want to be a backend developer, you should probably focus on Java, Python, Ruby, C#or whatever language/framework is in demand where you live. Most people that write to me are looking to become web developers so they need to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and a Javascript framework at a minimum.</p><h4 name="890e" id="890e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Should I Go to a Bootcamp?</h4><p name="59bc" id="59bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’ve used a few bootcamps to supplement my computer science fundamentals and have also taught at a few as well but that doesn’t mean I recommend them for everyone. If you have the money, time and dedication as well as realistic expectations then I would suggest going to an immersive program that has some sort of test to get in. A bootcamp that will accept anyone is usually a sign to me that they are more interested in enrolling fleshy money machines than really getting people hired. If money/time presents a problem then I totally think you can learn yourself into a career with dedication and focus.</p><h4 name="96af" id="96af" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What Framework Should I Learn?</h4><p name="a96e" id="a96e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">React. Maybe Angular if you don’t live on the west coast. ReactJS is the dominant framework and there is a troubling trend of companies saying they are looking for Javascript developers but really need people with ReactJS experience. If you are junior, then this expectation is even less flexible.</p><h4 name="8ea7" id="8ea7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How Can I Learn X?</h4><p name="20e6" id="20e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">YouTube. Udemy. Educative. A book if you’re a maniac maybe. My point is that there are a ton of free and not-so-free resources out there for people to use to learn how to compose software and websites. The main benefit that a bootcamp or mentor can provide is that they give you a very clear path of what to learn.</p><p name="9bf5" id="9bf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With so many free resources it can be easy to get paralyzed by choice or end up in a loop of never ending tutorials. Don’t do this. There is absolutely no substitute for putting finger to keyboard and bumbling through a new framework or language.</p><h4 name="5eb5" id="5eb5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">When Will I Be Ready To Begin Applying to Jobs?</h4><p name="6483" id="6483" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Yesterday most likely. Don’t make the mistake of waiting until you feel prepared to begin looking for positions or making connections on LinkedIn. I was probably less prepared than you when I began getting paid to code about 7 years ago. Apply for anything where you meet around 50% of the requirements. If you meet 100% of the requirements you are almost certainly over-qualified for the job.</p><h4 name="6129" id="6129" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">I Have No Prior Experience, What Should I Put On My Resume?</h4><p name="a0c8" id="a0c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is a tough one. Treat your resume like code and continue to refactor and iterate on it to improve it and get better results. I have seen people use projects they have worked on with the technologies listed, their role and a link to the repo. Others have put “freelance developer” as their most current position while others just use the same resume they’ve been using before getting into tech. I would only discourage the latter option as it can confuse people. If you worked at Burger King for the last 4 years, it could be difficult for a hiring manager to feel comfortable taking a chance on you or worse, assume you are not applying for a software developer position and toss your resume to their dog or toddler or whatever.</p><h4 name="38bd" id="38bd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">I Want To Do X But I’m Waiting For Y</h4><p name="a995" id="a995" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ok, this isn’t really a question but I hear some variation of this from too many people. “I want to start writing about this framework but I’m not an expert.” “I want to apply for this job but I’m not quite ready.” “I want to start doing LeetCode but first I need to brush up on my CS fundamentals.”</p><p name="c4d9" id="c4d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’ve said all of these things myself and finally realized how much time I wasted waiting for the right time. Write that article, apply for that job and stop letting LeetCode intimidate you.</p></div></div></section><section name="b949" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4bf3" id="4bf3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">If you have questions I didn’t answer here, drop a comment or find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjenney/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjenney/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>!</p></div></div></section>
