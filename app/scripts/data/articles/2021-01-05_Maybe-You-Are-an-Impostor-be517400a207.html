Check it out and maybe become an impostor <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">😅 or at least grab some free stuff on the site.</em></blockquote><p name="0da1" id="0da1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">At each stage of my career I’ve had a not-so-small voice in the back of my head questioning whether I was really qualified to be in my current position. Was it luck? Did my presence help to fill some diversity quota? Did they make a terrible mistake by hiring me, I wondered. It was just a matter of time before I was caught!</p><p name="1d4a" id="1d4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luckily,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> I’ve never been “caught” as an impostor</strong> at any of the companies I’ve worked for and I’ve learned to counter that voice of doubt with reason and logic — proving that I do belong where I am.</p><p name="4458" id="4458" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are dozens of articles and books written about impostor syndrome and they mostly start with the presumption that you are not, in fact, an impostor.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> I would argue that you must be at some point.</strong></p><p name="f18e" id="f18e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Making the transition to software developer at a much later stage than most people in the industry brought me a lot of anxiety. I was leaving a stable job at a community college and would be working with people in their early to mid 20’s with a lot more experience than me. I was starting my career path about a decade later than most of my peers.</p><p name="9253" id="9253" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I had learned to write code by the time I landed my first job, I had no clue about most of the logistics surrounding software development like version control, agile, peer reviews, or time estimates… also, I was still learning a LOT about writing code at this stage.</p><p name="8245" id="8245" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here I was, sitting around a group of developers, getting paid as a developer and writing code like a developer. I didn’t feel like one though. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In retrospect, I really wasn’t a true developer at this stage</strong>. I was sorta faking it. And that’s OK.</p><p name="85dd" id="85dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At some point in your career, whether you are transitioning into a new position or starting over in a new industry, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">you are likely going to feel unqualified and that’s because you still have a lot to learn.</strong> If we waited until we were ready for the next stage in life, we would probably be waiting for a long time.</p><p name="699e" id="699e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no magical aha moment where an engineer transitions to a manager or some test you pass that takes you from junior developer to senior software engineer. We’re often thrust into these new positions with the expectation that we will learn as we do. At this beginning stage we have essentially been hired/promoted based on our potential.</p><p name="0f8b" id="0f8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That voice of doubt, telling you that you don’t deserve whatever role/promotion/title you’ve just received isn’t exactly helpful. I mean, you could surely give up any forward progress and stay in the same place until you truly felt ready… tell me how that works out for you.</p><p name="b122" id="b122" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The benefit that impostor syndrome</strong> can provide is that it can be a catalyst to truly become the thing you feel you are faking. Perhaps you have just been made senior software engineer at your company and you don’t feel at all ready. Well, in your mind what does a senior software engineer do? What are the skills/traits of the seniors you respect? Write those things down and make a plan to acquire and internalize them.</p><p name="6b35" id="6b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I’m a bit neurotic and suffered through some nearly debilitating impostor syndrome during the first few years as a software engineer.</strong> This anxiety really hurt me at a particular startup where I was working and I just sort of shut down. My work suffered and I wasn’t participating in any discussions or decisions. I vowed to never let this happen again and one of the ways I decided to combat this feeling of doubt at my next company was to keep a log of all my accomplishments, week by week, month by month and a yearly summary where I could pick the top wins of the year.</p><p name="20a9" id="20a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Looking back at these small and big wins on days where I felt creeping impostor syndrome, gave me cold hard proof that I was adding value and making good progress on my team. Similarly, keeping a list of things I wanted to learn in order to get to the next level of my career provided a clear path to acquiring the skills I saw in the senior developers on my team.</p><h4 name="6c2b" id="6c2b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h4><p name="c6fd" id="c6fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You are smart, or else you wouldn’t be reading this article 😉. This is also makes it hard to lie to yourself. If you’ve been recently promoted, it’s not enough to combat those feelings of inadequacy with empty self-praise. It’s hard to tell yourself you are the best damn senior developer on the team if you are still understanding your role and expectations.</p><p name="2ca5" id="2ca5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Use that impostor syndrome as a starting point to really think about what you want to be in order to feel as if you belong. Tame that doubting voice with facts and accomplishments. Acquire what you admire in others in the same position.</p><p name="844d" id="844d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all begin as “impostors” in some form, and the louder our actions speak to the contrary (and maybe with some reminders from time to time) the quieter that voice becomes.</p><blockquote name="207e" id="207e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">I also own a small coding bootcamp — <a href="http://parsity.io" data-href="http://parsity.io" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parsity.io</a>.
