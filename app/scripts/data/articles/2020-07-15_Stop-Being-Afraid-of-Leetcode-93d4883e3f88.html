One of the senior engineers made a joke about the Traveling Salesman problem and everyone laughed, including me, even though I had no clue what the hell they were talking about.</p><figure name="5840" id="5840" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZrwQS5iBJm8MeyPwO9n3Tw.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="587" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZrwQS5iBJm8MeyPwO9n3Tw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">So then he’s like let’s use bubble sort to decrease runtime complexity…</figcaption></figure><p name="be49" id="be49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While most software developers will admit it’s fairly rare to re-implement common algorithms for sorting and searching or dreaded graph problems, learning them can only deepen your skillset and give you an appreciation for these algorithms which we leverage everyday.</p><p name="8261" id="8261" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re not really into learning for the sake of learning, then maybe the promise of money will give you the inspiration you need to study. If you’re planning on interviewing with any of the top (or even mid-level) tech companies and getting one of those coveted salaries you’re hoping will fill a void in your life with Teslas and AllBirds then you need to make Leetcode your friend.</p><p name="0d67" id="0d67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leetcode can be intimidating initially as you’re likely encountering problems that you’ve never come across in the course of your daily work and getting a solution, even a sub-optimal one can eat up hours of your time. At least at first.</p><blockquote name="07b9" id="07b9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’ve come to approach Leetcode in the same way I view exercising — a necessary habit, whose benefits aren’t always immediately apparent.</blockquote><p name="31a7" id="31a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The secret to getting good at Leetcode, is the same “secret” that will make you good at anything: consistency. Yeah, not the sexy answer you were looking for perhaps, but it’s the truth Ruth. Once you finish a nice variety of problems, research the answers and check out discussions, you will find patterns that emerge.</p><p name="7290" id="7290" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s my checklist for attacking a Leetcode problem:</p><figure name="b3a1" id="b3a1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*03Si5QZOusY-owHWnCipUQ.png" data-width="1980" data-height="1354" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*03Si5QZOusY-owHWnCipUQ.png"></figure><ol class="postList"><li name="cefd" id="cefd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure">Pick a question that is at the limit of your current knowledge. It won’t help you much to solve something that you’re totally familiar with.</li><li name="4dd2" id="4dd2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Thoroughly understand the problem you’re trying to solve and look at the example inputs and outputs before writing anything!</li><li name="ccf8" id="ccf8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Think through an approach, even a very naive, suboptimal one and begin coding the pieces you understand. Resist the urge to Google the question but instead Google the specific area you are having trouble with. In the example above, I needed to remind myself how to get the first element from an array and also the syntax used to get the remainder from division.</li><li name="c381" id="c381" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Once you have something resembling a solution, run that bad boy and see what the outcome is.</li><li name="b4ef" id="b4ef" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ok, it was wrong, for like the 20th time. At some point, you will have exhausted your mental capacity. Sometimes, after a night of sleep, I will wake up with a solution I didn’t consider in my previous attempts. Sometimes I won’t. This is when it’s time to check out the discussion of the question or peruse Medium for an article exploring the solution — that’s right, there are small articles written for almost every Leetcode question that is out there.</li><li name="3fcd" id="3fcd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Don’t copy and paste the solution. In fact, your goal should be to understand the problem just well enough that you can still craft your own solution, with some peeking at the solution you looked up in the previous step.</li><li name="2d15" id="2d15" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">After enough Leetcoding and researching all those problems that stop you in your tracks, you should begin to see a pattern of approaches that are used to solve a variety of problems: depth first search, breadth first search, binary search, sliding window…</li><li name="b4a0" id="b4a0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Repeat 1–7 often.</li></ol><p name="fe09" id="fe09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">While there are some people that live and die by Leetcode, I still believe it’s not necessarily the most effective tool to become a better developer but it is a necessity to get into top tier companies (for the most part), will make you better at problem solving and at the very least will allow you to get all the nerdy jokes your fellow developers make.</p></div></div></section>
