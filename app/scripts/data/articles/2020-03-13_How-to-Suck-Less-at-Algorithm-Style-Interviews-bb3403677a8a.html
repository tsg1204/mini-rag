How did we get here? Why? Is there a better way? Well, I’m not here to answer those questions (but thanks for asking) or debate the merits of algorithm style interviews. They are a reality and in order to get the job you want, you should be prepared for them.</p><p name="f2f2" id="f2f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see so many students preparing for front end and fullstack positions by putting all their efforts into a portfolio that few people will see and less will care about. In the last few years, I’ve done around 20 interviews and they all more or less followed the same pattern: usually they begin with a softball question or two like talking about something I’ve worked on or my previous experience, then some coding challenges — one algorithm (at least), build something like a small component, and maybe a system design question.</p><p name="4fa0" id="4fa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t like the fact that I was totally unprepared for these types of interviews and decided to do something about it after a few failed attempts early in my career. I did not study computer science in school so things like Big O notation, sorting and searching algorithms weren’t even on my radar when I got my first job. I was so busy writing terrible 100 line if else statements (please have mercy on me) and trying to learn basic SQL and not get fired that I simply didn’t do enough to make sure I was prepared for my next role, which I quickly learned the hard way.</p><p name="4089" id="4089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I perused the internets looking for places to study algorithms and over the years I’ve found a few gems out there:</p><h4 name="e5a6" id="e5a6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">CodeWars</h4><p name="05ac" id="05ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://www.codewars.com/" data-href="https://www.codewars.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codewars</a> is where I first cut my teeth on algo style questions. The video game style of interaction and gaining points gave it a more inviting feel than other sites I had come across and the questions tended to be easier as well. I think this is a great starting place for anyone who’s a bit intimidated by algorithms and needs to gain confidence by solving fairly simple toy problems. <a href="https://codesignal.com/" data-href="https://codesignal.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codefights</a> is another, similar platform that is both fun and good for beginners.</p><h4 name="2175" id="2175" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">LeetCode</h4><p name="ff10" id="ff10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://leetcode.com/" data-href="https://leetcode.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>, ahh, Leetcode. Every time a senior software developer dies, Leetcode gains another question. At least that’s what I’ve been told.</p><p name="b5ab" id="b5ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leetcode is the holy grail of algorithm study sites. If you plan on interviewing at any of the Big Five (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) you will need to spend a lot of time here. This is a great site to study those medium — hard style questions you will inevitably be asked during the marathon interview sessions that these companies will unleash on you. Facebook is well known for ripping questions directly from here to ask interviewees (I can confirm, as I was asked a medium question directly from here).</p><p name="4c61" id="4c61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While Leetcode is a great tool to get prepared for more difficult algo questions, it can be very difficult to begin here and if you aren’t chasing top tier companies, it may be overkill.</p><h4 name="652e" id="652e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">InterviewCake</h4><p name="ac5a" id="ac5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/" data-href="https://www.interviewcake.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InterviewCake</a> is a paid site and I’ve bought their year long subscription… twice! While it’s not cheap, I’d argue that if you nail one interview because of it, it’s worth its $250 price tag. The course is good in that it gives you a simple breakdown of well known problems like Djikstra, binary search and difficult data structures like heaps, trees and graphs as well as a code editor where you can test your skills. My only bone to pick with InterviewCake is that your subscription only lasts for a year and you have to renew at full price! Lame… but I can honestly say this course really helped me make sense of a lot of computer science concepts that were foreign to me.</p><h4 name="36d9" id="36d9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Educative</h4><p name="7746" id="7746" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview" data-href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Educative’s Grokking the Coding Interview</a> is my personal favorite of all the tools I’ve listed. It’s $80 for lifetime access (at the time of writing this) and does an excellent job of going over the most common patterns you are likely to see in an interview. I feel like studying the underlying patterns that make up the majority of interview questions helps you build up a strong foundation to tackle any problem, while burning through questions on Leetcode can feel like cramming for a test.</p><h4 name="3986" id="3986" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Get Prepared</h4><p name="8ab8" id="8ab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Whether you like it or not, algorithm style interviews can be the deciding factor not only in whether you get the job but at what level and salary you are offered when joining a company. I’d argue that there are better ways to judge candidates like pair programming or contract-style work but you’re far more likely to come face to face with a whiteboard. With the right amount of studying (and a little luck of course) you can stick it right back to that smug board and show it who’s boss. Or at least suck a lot less.</p><h4 name="4c2c" id="4c2c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">A note from JavaScript In Plain English</h4><p name="2d41" id="2d41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We have launched three new publications!
