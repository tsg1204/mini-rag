That’s why you’re not a senior dev</figcaption></figure><p name="5057" id="5057" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So you want to become a senior/staff/mid-level developer eh? Well, hopefully not all of them at the same time, but wherever you are in your career, you’re likely wondering what it will take to get to the next step. Let many authors tell it and you’ll believe that some finite number of steps or projects will land you the next title. It’s rarely that simple or consistent across companies.</p><p name="ab95" id="ab95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Years ago when I first began writing code, I had a goal of becoming a senior developer. I knew I had a long road to go and the path was unclear at best. What made a senior developer? Debugging skills? Project management? Git mastery? Writing excellent code? Some combination?</p><p name="14fb" id="14fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is that the expectations for a a senior developer can vary wildly from one company to another. I have a friend at a well known company on a team where anyone with more than one year of experience is officially titled a senior developer, while a senior software engineer at a startup may function more like a principal architect in the absence of an engineering hierarchy. Some companies have strict YOE requirements, some don’t 🤷‍♀.</p><p name="514e" id="514e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only way to define a clear path to the next level of your engineering career is to identify the skills that are needed at that level at your current company, both spoken and unspoken. Ask the people on your team who are the level you’d like to be at what it is they see as their primary responsibility and how it may differ from the previous level. How would they describe what they do and how is different than what someone at your level does?</p><p name="bb95" id="bb95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you have a manger, you should make your goal known to them and dig into the specifics of what it will take to get you towards this goal. What areas do you need to focus on and what kinds of projects/tasks can help you gain the necessary knowledge you may be lacking?</p><p name="a887" id="a887" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Armed with this information from both team mates and your manager, you can devise a plan of attack. You will take on some complex project, onboard new engineers, become a git master, fix all the TODOs littering your codebase… whatever it takes to prove you can perform at the next level. That’s good. But not enough.</p><p name="824d" id="824d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before you drop your burrito on the ground and furiously shake your head in frustration, just chill out. To really build your case to be a x -level developer, you need to make sure you have sufficient visibility of the work you are doing in that pursuit. That refactor of a micro-service you did last sprint which was particularly complex — let your manager know about it. Let your team know about it. Tell the world! Offer to pair with others in a public setting and volunteer for those critical bugs that others shy away from.</p><p name="f9c5" id="f9c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Like it or not, promotions can be as much about skill as they are about optics. It’s hard to make a case for yourself when you do work in the shadows or do all your communication over DMs or note passing.</p></div></div></section><section name="5ceb" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0500" id="0500" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">I do believe titles are important. They can determine your pay range, career trajectory and carry emotional value for many of us. That being said, a title is incredibly subjective and as such, there are hundreds (thousands?) of articles letting you know what that author considers to be a x-level developer. While that advice is often relevant and well-intentioned, your particular path is usually dictated by the company you are part of and your plan should reflect that, not the musings of some burnt-out, 37 year old, neurotic, Javascript code monkey… wait 🧐… too close to home. Anyways, good luck!</p></div></div></section>
