About 7 years ago I woke up under a bridge. Well, that’s not quite true. To wake up you have to have first been asleep. It’s more accurate…

Well, that’s not quite true. To wake up you have to have first been asleep. It’s more accurate to say I was smoking meth under a bridge. Like a troll. A meth troll.</p><p name="1ba7" id="1ba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wasn’t homeless by the way. Believe it or not, I was actually working at the time. A professional job with a buttoned shirt and everything. Crazy right? But not as crazy as you may think. My story may be like yours. Maybe instead of blowing out meth clouds under a bridge with your homeless dealer, you’re drinking one or three or 5 too many drinks on a Wednesday. Maybe you like to drink a few nose beers on a Friday 😉.</p><blockquote name="10de" id="10de" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If you’ve ever wondered to yourself, “Do I have a problem?” Yes my friend, you do.</blockquote><p name="b585" id="b585" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">You have a problem. You know it. How do you know if you have a problem, you ask? Well, it’s simple. If you’ve ever wondered to yourself, “Do I have a problem?” Yes my friend, you do.</p><h4 name="9d39" id="9d39" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How’d I Do It?</h4><p name="ff21" id="ff21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Fast forward 7 years and my life is unrecognizable. No more bridges. No meth, coke or alcohol! I’m a software engineer and an avid fitness enthusiast. I even made it to my trainer’s Instagram page as a before/after example 😎.</p><p name="952c" id="952c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So how’d I go from meth smoking, coke snorting, 40 guzzling degenerate to software engineer gym bro in a little over a year and stay there?</p><p name="1af9" id="1af9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, I didn’t go to AA.</p><p name="e461" id="e461" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Court ordered treatment? Nah.</p><p name="15f8" id="15f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jail stint? Nope.</p><p name="10e4" id="10e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did have an intervention though. Yup, just like you see on TV. It was Easter Sunday and my mother dropped my house. My girlfriend and our 2 kids were sick of my shit. They were going to leave if I didn’t pull it together.</p><p name="b4f1" id="b4f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hell, I was going to die at the rate I was going.</p><p name="8eaa" id="8eaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mom read me a letter, gave me an ultimatum and she cried. I cried. I was pissed. Also, I was drunk and hadn’t slept because, you know…. cocaine.</p><p name="51c6" id="51c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fuck it. I’ll try, I said. I really just needed her to stop crying. I’d give this thing a few days and wait for it to blow over.</p><h4 name="6e02" id="6e02" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How I Stumbled Into Commitment</h4><p name="648f" id="648f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I had no idea how I was going to get through the first week. But I had to do that much at least. Since 18, I had never gone more than 3 days without drinking.</p><p name="8726" id="8726" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I told my friends I wasn’t drinking anymore. I told everyone I knew about what had happened and that I’d be out of the drinking game for a bit.</p><p name="ead0" id="ead0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So… how long you gonna stop?</p><p name="ba84" id="ba84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Something about the way people asked me that question got to me. Or maybe, my own insecurity about my ability to really quit got to me.</p><p name="0280" id="0280" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I responded, “I don’t know.”</p><p name="69e4" id="69e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Telling everyone that I was done with drinking for the time being put me in a tight spot. I couldn’t backslide too quickly now. How embarrassing would it be if someone saw me in the bar just a week after I told them I’d been intervention-ed?</p><p name="5271" id="5271" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I threw away all the alcohol in the house. I erased the dealers’ numbers out of my phone. Now what?</p><h4 name="ebf9" id="ebf9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What Do I Do With All This Time?</h4><p name="4547" id="4547" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The 24 hours in a sober day creep by a lot slower.</p><p name="6bad" id="6bad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My sleep was fucked. I was either barely able to pass out or taking 12 hour marathon snooze sessions.</p><p name="8a99" id="8a99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wanted sweets. Lots of them. At night I’d walk to the local liquor store and pick up a pack of gummy bears, a chocolate bar and a soda. Anything to fill the spot.</p><p name="16c9" id="16c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Weekends were the worst. I needed something to fill in the time I spent at bars or milling around the city in a drunken stupor.</p><p name="fa05" id="fa05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Movies take up large chunks of time. So I rented and went out to every movie that looked watchable. It’s still one of my favorite sober habits.</p><p name="f89b" id="f89b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, I began looking into other hobbies, like computer programming which ended up leading me into a new career. Exercising quickly followed. I started out running for a little under a mile. Years of smoking had left me in hideous shape and the candy bar habit I picked up wasn’t really helping either. I didn’t exactly know why I was running but I kept at it. I liked the feeling at the end of a run and letting my mind wander during it.</p><p name="99a2" id="99a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I can do this, I thought.</p><p name="552d" id="552d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So far, so good.</p><h4 name="317a" id="317a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Happily Ever After?</h4><p name="0e78" id="0e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I still get cravings. I still have a massive urge to backslide that seems to come out of nowhere. So I write about it. I share my story and exercise like a mad man. I watch movies on Thursday nights and go to the theatre a lot. I still eat a fucking ton of candy 😅.</p><h4 name="2bb5" id="2bb5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What You Need to Do Right Now</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="ca50" id="ca50" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Tell everyone you are going to quit — this makes your success more likely. It will also tell you a lot about what your “friends” think of you.</li><li name="a7f7" id="a7f7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Throw away everything in the cabinet. Why sabotage yourself you damn fool? Don’t test your willpower. You’ve already proven you have little of it.</li><li name="1b17" id="1b17" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fill in the time. Eat terrible shit. Do a 1000 piece puzzle. Watch a fuckton of movies. Better yet, exercise and read. Whatever. Do something. Anything.</li><li name="719a" id="719a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Well, do anything but also… exercise. Yeah, you have to. It’s the easiest way to ensure your long term sobriety. I don’t give a fuck what article you read or who told you different. You MUST exercise!</li></ul><p name="b4b5" id="b4b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">Lastly, stop worrying about the future. It sounds corny but just get through each day. Own the day and you will be on a path to long term sobriety. Not drinking for a year sounds impossible. Start with a day.</p></div></div></section>
