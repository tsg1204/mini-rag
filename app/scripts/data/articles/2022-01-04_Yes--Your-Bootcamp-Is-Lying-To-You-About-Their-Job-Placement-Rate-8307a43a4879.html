Been on LinkedIn lately? How many articles will you read today from recent grads that haven’t been able to find a job in 3 months. 6 Months. 1 year! Or who have completely given up and gone back to their former career. It can be demoralizing to read through these stories as a developer on the job hunt.</p><p name="8af4" id="8af4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t want this to be all doom and gloom, however.</p><p name="ea40" id="ea40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, your bootcamp is likely using creative math to inflate their job placement numbers or outright lying like Lambda School.</p><p name="c27c" id="c27c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are humans at the end of the day and there are too many external factors that can affect your personal job search to ever guarantee that you will land a job as a software developer in some finite amount of time.</p><p name="4694" id="4694" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe you barely graduated from your program. Maybe you’re only applying to FAANG (tc or gtfo). Perhaps you just aren’t in a rush to get hired and dragging your feet. Maybe it’s just a bad time of year… many companies wait to hire at certain times of the year.</p><p name="4457" id="4457" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are too many reasons why you, specifically, may not be getting hired.</p><p name="45d0" id="45d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Should you give up on your dreams of becoming a developer and eschew all bootcamp programs? No, you fool.</p><p name="ea1e" id="ea1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What you should focus on are the foundational skills that will ensure you are prepared when you meet the right opportunity. The worst mistake I’ve seen students I’ve taught make is to immediately stop coding once their bootcamp ends. Their Githhub history takes a sharp decline the moment guided instruction ends.</p><p name="a600" id="a600" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are really only 2 problems that recent bootcamp graduates encounter:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="a4ed" id="a4ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Not getting interviews</li><li name="9743" id="9743" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Getting interviews and not passing them</li></ol><p name="f1ac" id="f1ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Luckily, these are solvable problems. Each requires a different skillset but they are far from insurmountable.</p><p name="b5ce" id="b5ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t get bogged down in the sob stories littering LinkedIn or the fact that your bootcamp program may not be forthcoming in their actual job placement numbers. Focus on getting 500 connections on LinkedIn. A/B test your resume and keep a side project going to keep your coding skills sharp. You may not be able to control the length of your search but you can certainly make sure you are discoverable and have the right skills to get hired when the opportunity arises.</p><p name="75b9" id="75b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Want a hand in getting your first (or not so first) job in tech as a developer by learning the skills that will get your discoverable and hire-able</strong>?
