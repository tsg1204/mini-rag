I’ve actually heard some variation of this statement dozens of times over the years. People watch Silicon Valley, maybe they’ve read some fluff article in their local paper about how an 11 year old kid built a million dollar app or how students across the nation are learning to code in the classroom and think “Can’t be that hard can it?” All I gotta do is memorize some codes or something and then jam them out in some logical sequence right? Next step, app store fame and remote work on a beach!</p><p name="6805" id="6805" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me let you in on a little secret there, bucko, the path to coding is well paved but there are many forks on this road and a lot of endless loops, so many endless loops and… well, perhaps metaphors aren’t my forte (this is why I ended up coding and not writing great American novels) but what I’m trying to say is that learning to be a hirable front end or full stack developer will require you to be familiar with a lot of technology.</p><p name="1f74" id="1f74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is my list of basic skills that I think are generally required to get your foot in the door.</p><p name="6d29" id="6d29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">HTML + CSS</strong></p><p name="dfc7" id="dfc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean duh, right. You better understand HTML and CSS, the DOM (look it up if you don’t know) and how to do things like write media queries, use pseudo selectors, probably a CSS framework like Bootstrap and flexbox.</p><p name="a678" id="a678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Basically, if you can re-create the landing page of a popular site (not Google) using HTML and CSS and make it responsive (looks good on phone and browser) then you probably know enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous.</p><p name="772b" id="772b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Javascript</strong></p><p name="3a3c" id="3a3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Knowing only HTML and CSS can actually land you a job, but not likely as a front end developer. You’re going to need to know Javascript and considering that most interviews will throw some sort of algorithm style question at you, it’s in your best interest to know it well.</p><p name="ad73" id="ad73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After you get past the basics of making something happens when a button is clicked, you’ll need to dive deeper into asynchronous Javascript, closure and what the heck <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">this</code> means. Having some knowledge of these more advanced topics are often the key to getting past an initial phone screening. Also, they make you better at your job.</p><p name="aad4" id="aad4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Terminal</strong></p><p name="48fd" id="48fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ve seen those hacker movies where some guy is typing code into some black screen with green colored type? Well, that’s the command line, or the terminal. In order to be an effective developer, you’re gonna need to know how to navigate between files using the command line and there are so many programs specifically designed to be run in the terminal that you will have to feel a confident with basic commands.</p><p name="82fb" id="82fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you can find a file on your desktop using the command line and print the contents of a file to the screen, I’d say you have a good foundation. Bonus points if you can open and then exit Vim, your native text editor in the terminal.</p><p name="34f8" id="34f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Git and Github</strong></p><p name="a865" id="a865" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Writing code professionally is a team sport and you’re going to need to know how to share your code with others. Github is an online platform that allows people to share and edit work as well as keep track of file history and revisions which can really come in handy if you make a mistake and need to revert to a working copy or if several people will be working in the same codebase.</p><p name="ed18" id="ed18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you learn basic git, look into merges, solving merge conflicts and branching strategies. This is one of those skills which will serve you well at whatever company you work for.</p><p name="c431" id="c431" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Javascript Framework</strong></p><p name="5734" id="5734" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pick one. Go ahead, just pick one. There are 1 million and 4 articles written each day about which JS framework you should choose. Just pick one and stick with it. Maybe not Vue. Yeah I said it, sorry, but here we are.</p><p name="0691" id="0691" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d say React is likely the safest bet with Angular being a close second. Developers switch companies all the time and they don’t all use the same framework. What’s more important is your underlying knowledge of JS which will make you able to pick up new frameworks as they come into fashion.</p><p name="fae2" id="fae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Databases</strong></p><p name="be08" id="be08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like it or not, you will be interacting with databases in some way. Perhaps you’ll be constructing the queries to fetch data or at a smaller startup you may be involved in actually creating and scaling databases.</p><p name="b172" id="b172" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Knowing the difference between SQL and No-SQL databases is a great start and can help you speak intelligently if an interviewer asks you what DB you might use given a specific scenario. I’ve found HackerRank to be a particular good place to learn some SQL and there many other places to try your hand at basic SQL which is ubiquitous especially among more established companies.</p><p name="127d" id="127d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Algorithms</strong></p><p name="ebdd" id="ebdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learn some. No one will expect you to be an expert at obscure algorithms, especially if you are an entry level developer but I’d bet that the majority of your interviews will involve at least one algo style interview question.</p><p name="db36" id="db36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leetcode is the site of choice for most programmers as they study for Google or all the Google-wannabes and learn to invert binary trees and find the most common number in an array. If you can muddle your way through some of the easier questions and maybe a few of the medium level ones then I’d say you’re in good shape as an entry level candidate at a lower tier company.</p><p name="443c" id="443c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But Wait…</strong></p><p name="88c9" id="88c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s always more. Writing tests, deployments, system design, bagjaggery… alright, I made that last one up, but you see what I’m getting at. To be honest, I was hired with considerably less of these skills than outlined here but had to quickly learn them to be hirable when I went on the hunt again and my journey with things like algorithms and Javascript is ongoing.</p><p name="9f63" id="9f63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This no frills path is what I would consider the basics needed to be competitive so when I hear people casually saying they want to pick up code and become a developer, I just say, “Oh,” because it’s easier than spouting off this laundry list of skills. Oh, indeed.</p></div></div></section>
