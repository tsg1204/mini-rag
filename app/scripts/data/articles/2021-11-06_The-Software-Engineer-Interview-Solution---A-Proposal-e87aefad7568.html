No pressure though!</figcaption></figure><p name="a665" id="a665" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A member of your team has just left for another opportunity 😢. While you and your team are excited for them, you also realize you have a backlog of user stories with looming deadlines. It’s time to hire.</p><p name="b09c" id="b09c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You believe you need a warm body capable of producing code to maintain your team’s average output. You’re not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">totally</em> wrong. I would argue that in order to continually improve your team, maintain engagement and create great products — what you really need is a person who can increase its average technical ability. A bar-raiser.</p><p name="6d47" id="6d47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This bar-raising developer will ideally offer more or deeper technical expertise and/or skills that will be needed in the near future. Your current team gets the benefit of this person’s knowledge and offers this new member an opportunity to mentor others in a meaningful way and learn from them as well.</p><p name="3544" id="3544" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, how do you determine what constitutes a bar-raising candidate?</p><p name="ab6f" id="ab6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A LeetCode style interview just won’t cut it here. You may get the best damn competitive programmer in your local area only to realize they aren’t actually that good at what your team really does — create UI focused web apps. Or social media networks that tear at the very fabric of society. Or whatever.</p><p name="5fed" id="5fed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A game of engineering trivia may net you a candidate who has read through all the docs surrounding popular programming languages. Can you explain how a left-join works? How about the IE box-model? Blah!</p><p name="024d" id="024d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is my controversial proposal:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6e55" id="6e55" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Identify the true skills</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">your team currently needs and what it will need in the future. </strong>For a front end focused team, perhaps page load time and writing performant React components is a weak spot. You also know that an effort to migrate some JS apps to Typescript is on your technical roadmap.</li><li name="e740" id="e740" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Here’s the weird part. <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Test a representative slice of your own team on the skills you have identified in part 1</strong>. Have them take the same test/challenge you plan to use for candidates.</li><li name="8edc" id="8edc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Score your current team on their performance in the challenge you’ve given using a discrete set of criteria</strong>. What is the average score?</li><li name="ae83" id="ae83" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Using this same test/challenge you now have a baseline</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">that candidates need to “beat” in order to be considered bar raisers</strong>. Candidates who do considerably better than your team are likely worth moving forward in the process. Those that do about the same may be good enough if they’ve shown promise in other areas and those who score significantly lower will be the least likely to move forward.</li></ol><p name="0eb6" id="0eb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">As an added benefit, your team now has an intimate knowledge of the process you are using to hire. Outlandish expectations and time sucking challenges will hopefully be extinguished before reaching the public and you now have an arguably more objective method to understand how new candidates compare with your current team members and their relative level of seniority.</p></div></div></section><section name="221a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4781" id="4781" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Now, of course there are some drawbacks to this method of interviewing and I can already see you shaking your head at this point in the article. Good! I think we’re nearly all in agreement that the current interview process is not sufficient to test the relevant skills of software engineers and as humans, we can be pretty biased. Is “liking” a candidate enough? A good feeling about them you say? Yet another LeetCode problem? It’s time to at least consider alternatives.</p><p name="1568" id="1568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If you have an efficient interview method that has worked for you and your team — share it! 👇</p></div></div></section>
