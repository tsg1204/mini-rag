/**
 * PINECONE VECTOR DATABASE INTEGRATION
 *
 * This file handles interactions with Pinecone, a managed vector database service.
 *
 * WHAT IS A VECTOR DATABASE?
 * Vector databases store high-dimensional numerical representations (embeddings) of data.
 * Unlike traditional databases that store exact text/numbers, vector DBs store "meanings"
 * as mathematical vectors. This enables semantic search - finding content by meaning
 * rather than exact keyword matches.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. Text content gets converted to embeddings (arrays of ~1500 numbers) using AI models
 * 2. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text
 * 3. When searching, your query also gets converted to an embedding
 * 4. The database finds the most similar embeddings using mathematical distance
 * 5. This returns content that's semantically similar to your query
 *
 * EXAMPLE: Searching for "climate change" might return articles about:
 * - "global warming" (similar meaning, different words)
 * - "carbon emissions" (related concept)
 * - "environmental policy" (contextually related)
 *
 * Learn more: https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/overview
 *
 * EXPERIMENT: Try changing the embedding model or topK values below!
