# AI-Powered Content Generation and RAG

A full-stack TypeScript application demonstrating modern AI techniques including RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), fine-tuning, agents, and LLM observability with automated web scraping capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need to set up the following services:

### Required API Keys

1. **OpenAI API Key** (https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

    - You'll need at least $5 in credits on your OpenAI account
    - Used for embeddings, chat completions, and fine-tuning

2. **Pinecone API Key** (https://www.pinecone.io/)

    - Free tier available
    - Used for vector database storage and similarity search

3. **Helicone API Key** (https://www.helicone.ai/)

## 🚨 Your Mission: Fix This Broken App

**This app doesn't work yet.** Your job is to build it from scratch by completing exercises and TODOs. When you're done, you'll have a fully functional AI-powered chat app with:

1. **RAG Agent** - Chat with your knowledge base (technical docs, articles, etc.)
2. **LinkedIn Agent** - Fine-tuned on Brian's LinkedIn posts to generate professional content

### What You Need To Do:

**Step 1: Understand Vector Math (30 mins)**

Before writing any code, build intuition for how embeddings work:

```bash
# Run the word arithmetic exercise
yarn exercise:word-math
```

This demonstrates "word math" like `king - man + woman ≈ queen`. Understanding this is crucial for understanding RAG.

**Step 2: Set Up Your Vector Database**

Create a Pinecone index and configure your environment:

1. Sign up at [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) (free tier)
2. Create an index:
    - Name: `rag-tutorial`
    - Dimensions: `512`
    - Metric: `cosine`
3. Add to `.env`:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
    PINECONE_API_KEY=...
    PINECONE_INDEX=rag-tutorial
    ```

-   Learn: [Pinecone Quickstart](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/quickstart)

**Step 3: Upload Knowledge Base to Pinecone**

Scrape documentation and upload embeddings:

```bash
# Edit app/scripts/scrapeAndVectorizeContent.ts to add your URLs
# Then run:
yarn tsx app/scripts/scrapeAndVectorizeContent.ts
```

This will scrape URLs, chunk the content, generate embeddings, and upload to Pinecone.

**Step 4: Train Your LinkedIn Agent**

Fine-tune a model on Brian's LinkedIn posts:

```bash
# (Optional) Estimate cost before training
yarn tsx app/scripts/estimate-training-cost.ts

# Upload to OpenAI and start fine-tuning job
yarn tsx app/scripts/upload-training-data.ts
```

Once training completes (~10-20 mins), add the model ID to `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_FINETUNED_MODEL=ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal::YOUR_ID
```

-   Learn: [OpenAI Fine-Tuning Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning), [When to Fine-Tune vs RAG](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/when-to-use-fine-tuning)

**Step 5: Fix All The TODOs**

Search the codebase for `TODO` comments - you'll find them in:

-   `app/api/upload-document/route.ts` - Implement document upload pipeline
-   `app/libs/openai/agents/linkedin-agent.ts` - Complete LinkedIn agent
-   `app/libs/openai/agents/rag-agent.ts` - Build RAG retrieval and generation
-   `app/libs/openai/agents/selector-agent.ts` - Create agent router

Key concepts you'll implement:

-   **RAG**: [What is RAG?](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/), [Vector Similarity Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases)
-   **Agents**: [OpenAI Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs), [Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
-   **Streaming**: [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), [Server-Sent Events](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming)

**Step 6: Run The App**

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and test:

-   Upload new documents (URLs or raw text)
-   Ask technical questions (should use RAG agent)
-   Request LinkedIn posts (should use fine-tuned agent)

**Step 7: Run Tests**

```bash
# Test your agent selector
yarn test:selector

# Test all implementations
yarn test
```

### Hints:

-   The `working_version` branch has the complete solution if you get stuck
-   Use `console.log()` liberally to understand data flow
-   Check Pinecone dashboard to verify vectors are uploaded
-   Use Helicone dashboard to debug LLM calls and see cost
-   Read the inline comments in TODO sections - they guide you step-by-step

**Good luck! Figure it out. 🚀**

## Pinecone vs Qdrant 
Pinecone is easier and more polished; Qdrant is more flexible and cost-efficient.


## Chunking Strategy

Core Principles (apply to everything)
    - One idea per chunk
    - Chunks should stand alone (readable without surrounding text)
    - Context travels with the chunk (title, source, date, type)
    - Chunk size follows content length, not a single fixed rule

Articles (Long-Form Content) Strategy
    - Structure-aware chunking
    - Split articles by logical sections (headings or topic shifts)
    - Each chunk represents one coherent concept or argument
    - Intro and conclusion are treated as separate, high-value chunks

LinkedIn Posts (Short-Form Content) Strategy
    - Whole-post chunking by default
    - One post = one chunk
    - Post text is preserved as-is, with minimal normalization
    - Context is critical and must be attached to each chunk

    When to split
        Only if the post clearly contains:
        A framework (steps, numbered ideas)
        Distinct sections (hook → story → lessons)

Articles are chunked by meaning and structure; LinkedIn posts are chunked by intent and context.
